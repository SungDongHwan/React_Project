# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

uilds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run build` fails to minify

This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)

double rnum = Math.random();

int num = (int) (rnum * 10);

3. 주석처리: 교재 98, <ctrl />

여러줄 주석 처리: 블록 지정후 <ctrl +shift +/>, 해제는 해당 블록 선택후 <ctrl+shift+\>

4. 디버깅 방법: 교재 125~128\

map은 한번씩돌면서 새로운 배열을 반환해주는데, 

```java
map((i)=>{ .... }) 와 같은 문법을 쓸때는 return문을 무조건 써줘야한다.
map((i)=> ....<div></div> )가 될때는 return문을 안써도 된다. 이떄는 변수를 따로 선언해줘서 가능.

💡 각 과목별 정리를 맞춰서 하되, 내가 알고있는것(코드를 짤수있는 것)만 정리할것.
